##About

Using [Chartist.js](http://gionkunz.github.io/chartist-js/), this [TablePress](https://tablepress.org/) extension  creates a responsive chart based on the data in your TablePress table


##Usage

Add the `chartist=true` parameter to your TablePress shortcode, eg: `[table id=1 chartist=true /]`

**Optional parameters**

* Show/hide chart line: `chartist_showline=true`(default:true)
* Show/hide show chart area: `chartist_showarea=false` (default:false)
* Set chart y low: `chartist_low=0` (default: table low)
* Set chart y high: `chartist_high=10` (default: table high)
* Enable/disable smooth line: `chartist_linesmooth=true` (default:true)
* Enable/disable line points: `chartist_showpoint=true` (default:true)
* Set chart aspect ratio: `chartist_aspect_ratio=3:4` (default:3:4) Alternatives: 1, 15:16, 8:9, 5:6, 4:5, 3:4, 2:3, 5:8, 1:1.618, 3:5, 9:16, 8:15, 1:2, 2:5, 3:8, 1:3 or 1:4

In TablePress, if table head is set, the extention will use the row as chart labels.
